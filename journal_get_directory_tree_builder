find ./app/assets -print | sed -e "s;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|; |;g"

(if that's the right folder to begin with, idk) in order to check what's actually in the dir, that is the tree

| |____assets
| | |____stylesheets
| | | |____application.tailwind.css
| | | |____sessions.css
| | | |____inter.scss
| | |____javascripts
| | | |____channels
| | | | |____.keep
| | |____config
| | | |____manifest.js
| | |____builds
| | | |____slack-DE6Z2S65.digested.png
| | | |____application.js
etc.
